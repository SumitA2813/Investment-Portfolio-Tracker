# Investment Portfolio Tracker

## Overview
The **Investment Portfolio Tracker** is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to manage their investment portfolio efficiently by adding new investments, viewing and updating their portfolio, and visualizing asset distribution through an interactive pie chart.

## Features
### 1. Add a New Investment
Users can add investments by providing the asset name, amount invested, and current value. The total portfolio value is updated dynamically.

### 2. View and Update Portfolio
The portfolio dashboard displays all investments with details like asset name, invested amount, current value, and percentage change. Users can also update the current value of each investment, which automatically recalculates the percentage change and updates the total portfolio value.

### 3. Remove an Investment
Users can remove investments from the portfolio. The total portfolio value will be updated upon removal.

### 4. Visualize Portfolio Performance
A dynamic pie chart shows the distribution of investments by asset, updating as investments are added, modified, or removed.
